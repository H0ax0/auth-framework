# Storage Security Implementation Verification Script
#
# This script demonstrates the storage security fixes implemented in response to
# the comprehensive storage audit. It verifies that:
# 1. Client Registry now properly persists data
# 2. PAR requests survive server restarts
# 3. All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
