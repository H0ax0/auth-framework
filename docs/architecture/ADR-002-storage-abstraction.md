# ADR-002: Storage Layer Abstraction

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AuthFramework needs to support multiple storage backends for different deployment scenarios:

- **Development**: In-memory storage for testing and prototyping
- **Production**: Redis for high-performance caching and session storage
- **Enterprise**: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex queries
- **Cloud**: Cloud-native databases like AWS DynamoDB or Azure Cosmos DB
- **Hybrid**: Multiple storage types for different data categories

Different applications have varying requirements for persistence, performance, consistency, and scalability. A hardcoded storage solution would limit adoption and flexibility.

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive storage abstraction layer using the `AuthStorage` trait with multiple concrete implementations:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait AuthStorage: Send + Sync {
    async fn store_token(&self, token: &AuthToken) -> Result<()>;
    async fn get_token(&self, token_id: &str) -> Result<Option<AuthToken>>;
    async fn delete_token(&self, token_id: &str) -> Result<()>;
    // ... additional storage operations
}
```

Provide built-in implementations for common storage backends and enable custom implementations.

## Rationale

Storage abstraction provides several critical benefits:

- **Deployment Flexibility**: Choose optimal storage for each environment
- **Performance Optimization**: Use specialized storage for different data types
- **Testing Support**: In-memory storage for reliable, fast tests
- **Migration Path**: Switch storage backends without code changes
- **Cloud Compatibility**: Support for various cloud database services
- **Compliance Requirements**: Enterprise databases for audit and compliance

This approach follows the Dependency Inversion Principle and enables testable, flexible deployments.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Environment Flexibility**: Optimal storage choice for each deployment
- **Performance Tuning**: Specialized storage backends for specific needs
- **Simplified Testing**: Fast, reliable in-memory storage for tests
- **Easy Migration**: Storage backend changes without application updates
- **Cloud Native**: Support for cloud database services
- **Enterprise Ready**: ACID-compliant databases for enterprise requirements

### Negative Consequences

- **Configuration Complexity**: Multiple storage options require careful configuration
- **Feature Parity**: Not all storage backends support identical features
- **Testing Complexity**: Must test against multiple storage implementations
- **Abstraction Overhead**: Some storage-specific optimizations may be lost

### Neutral Consequences

- **Code Organization**: Clear separation between business logic and persistence
- **Dependency Management**: Storage-specific dependencies are optional

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Hardcoded Redis Storage

- **Description**: Use Redis as the only storage backend
- **Why Not Chosen**: Limited deployment options, no enterprise database support
- **Trade-offs**: Simpler implementation but restricted flexibility

### Alternative 2: Database-Per-Feature

- **Description**: Different databases for tokens, sessions, users, etc.
- **Why Not Chosen**: Complex configuration, potential consistency issues
- **Trade-offs**: Optimal performance per feature but operational complexity

### Alternative 3: Storage Plugins

- **Description**: Runtime-loadable storage implementations
- **Why Not Chosen**: Security concerns, deployment complexity
- **Trade-offs**: Maximum flexibility but security and stability risks

## Implementation

The storage abstraction was implemented through:

1. **Core Trait Definition**: Comprehensive `AuthStorage` trait covering all operations
2. **Built-in Implementations**: Memory, Redis, and PostgreSQL implementations
3. **Configuration System**: Unified configuration for all storage backends
4. **Error Handling**: Storage-agnostic error types and handling
5. **Testing Framework**: Storage implementation test suite
6. **Migration Tools**: Utilities for moving data between storage backends

Key components:

- `MemoryStorage`: For development and testing
- `RedisStorage`: For high-performance production deployments
- `PostgreSQLStorage`: For enterprise and ACID compliance requirements
- `CustomStorage`: Template for custom implementations
