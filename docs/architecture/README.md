# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the AuthFramework project. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the project's development, providing context for future maintainers and developers.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standardized format:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The situation and constraints that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The architectural decision that was made
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes of the decision
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated

## Decision Process

1. **Identify**: Recognize when an architectural decision needs to be made
2. **Document**: Create an ADR with the decision context and options
3. **Review**: Get feedback from the development team
4. **Decide**: Make the decision and update the ADR status
5. **Implement**: Apply the decision in the codebase
6. **Monitor**: Track the consequences and update if needed

## Guidelines

- ADRs should be written in plain language accessible to all team members
- Include concrete examples and code snippets where helpful
- Document both positive and negative consequences honestly
- Update ADRs when decisions are superseded or deprecated
- Reference related ADRs to show decision evolution

## Templates

Use the [ADR Template](templates/adr-template.md) when creating new Architecture Decision Records.
