# ADR-005: JWT Token Management Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AuthFramework requires robust JWT token management for multiple use cases:

- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived tokens for API authorization
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived tokens for access token renewal
- **ID Tokens**: OpenID Connect identity tokens with user claims
- **Custom Tokens**: Application-specific token types
- **Token Security**: Protection against common JWT vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: High-throughput token operations in production
- **Standards Compliance**: OAuth 2.1, OpenID Connect, RFC 8725 requirements

JWT tokens are critical security components requiring careful lifecycle management, secure defaults, and protection against known attack vectors.

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive JWT token management strategy with multiple security layers:

**Token Types and Lifecycle:**

- Access tokens: 15-minute default expiration, configurable
- Refresh tokens: 30-day default expiration, single-use rotation
- ID tokens: 1-hour expiration, immediate use
- Custom tokens: Application-configurable expiration

**Security Measures:**

- Multiple signing algorithms: RS256 (default), HS256, ES256, EdDSA
- Algorithm validation to prevent algorithm confusion attacks
- Mandatory audience and issuer validation
- Secure key rotation with multiple active keys
- Token binding with DPoP proof-of-possession

## Rationale

This comprehensive approach addresses critical security and operational requirements:

- **Security First**: Prevents common JWT vulnerabilities through secure defaults
- **Standards Compliance**: Meets OAuth 2.1 and RFC 8725 security requirements
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput production environments
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple algorithms and token types
- **Operational**: Key rotation and monitoring capabilities

The strategy follows JWT security best practices and industry standards.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Strong Security**: Protection against algorithm confusion, token replay, and other attacks
- **Standards Compliance**: Full OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect compatibility
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput production workloads
- **Operational Excellence**: Key rotation, monitoring, and debugging capabilities
- **Flexibility**: Multiple algorithms and token types for different use cases
- **Future-Proof**: Support for emerging JWT security standards

### Negative Consequences

- **Complexity**: Multiple algorithms and security features require careful configuration
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation operational requirements
- **Performance Overhead**: Cryptographic operations and validation have computational costs
- **Storage Requirements**: Token metadata and revocation lists require storage

### Neutral Consequences

- **Algorithm Choice**: Applications must choose appropriate algorithms for their security requirements
- **Monitoring**: Token lifecycle events generate significant log volume

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Simple JWT with HS256 Only

- **Description**: Basic JWT implementation with only HMAC-SHA256 signing
- **Why Not Chosen**: Limited security, no key rotation, algorithm confusion vulnerability
- **Trade-offs**: Simpler implementation but inadequate security for production

### Alternative 2: Opaque Tokens

- **Description**: Random tokens with server-side storage for claims
- **Why Not Chosen**: Higher server load, no offline validation, limited OAuth compatibility
- **Trade-offs**: Simpler token format but scaling and compatibility limitations

### Alternative 3: Encrypted JWTs (JWE)

- **Description**: Always encrypt JWT payloads in addition to signing
- **Why Not Chosen**: Performance overhead, complexity, limited ecosystem support
- **Trade-offs**: Maximum payload protection but significant operational complexity

## Implementation

The JWT strategy was implemented through:

1. **Token Manager**: Centralized `TokenManager` for all JWT operations
2. **Algorithm Support**: Multiple signing algorithms with secure defaults
3. **Security Validation**: Comprehensive claim validation and security checks
4. **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation capabilities
5. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient cryptographic operations and caching
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive token lifecycle logging and metrics

Key implementation features:

```rust
// Multiple algorithm support
let config = JwtConfig::with_rsa_keys(private_key, public_key, issuer)?
    .with_algorithm(Algorithm::RS256)
    .with_expiration(900); // 15 minutes

// Secure token creation
let claims = CommonJwtClaims::new(issuer, subject, audience, expiration)
    .with_custom_claim("scope", json!("read write"))
    .with_jti(generate_secure_token(16));

// Comprehensive validation
let validated_claims = jwt_manager.verify_token(&token)?;
```
