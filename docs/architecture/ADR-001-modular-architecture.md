# ADR-001: Modular Architecture Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AuthFramework needed to support multiple deployment scenarios and use cases:

- Microservice architectures requiring individual component deployment
- Monolithic applications needing all authentication features
- Testing scenarios requiring component isolation
- Performance-critical applications needing minimal dependencies
- Custom authentication flows requiring component extensibility

The initial framework design was monolithic, making it difficult to use only specific components and creating tight coupling between features.

## Decision

Implement a modular architecture with separate managers for distinct authentication concerns:

- **MfaManager**: Multi-factor authentication coordination
- **SessionManager**: Session lifecycle and security management
- **UserManager**: User account and profile operations
- **TokenManager**: JWT token creation and validation
- **PermissionChecker**: Authorization and access control

Each manager operates independently while sharing common storage and configuration interfaces.

## Rationale

The modular design addresses several critical requirements:

- **Composability**: Applications can include only needed components
- **Testability**: Individual managers can be tested in isolation
- **Performance**: Reduced memory footprint for specialized deployments
- **Extensibility**: Custom managers can replace or extend existing ones
- **Microservice Support**: Individual managers can be deployed as separate services

This approach follows the Single Responsibility Principle and enables better separation of concerns.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Reduced Dependencies**: Applications only include required components
- **Improved Testability**: Isolated unit testing of individual managers
- **Better Performance**: Lower memory usage and faster startup times
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Custom authentication flows through manager composition
- **Cleaner Code**: Clear boundaries between authentication concerns
- **Microservice Ready**: Easy deployment in distributed architectures

### Negative Consequences

- **Additional Complexity**: More interfaces and coordination logic required
- **Potential Duplication**: Some common functionality may be repeated across managers
- **Configuration Overhead**: Each manager requires separate configuration
- **Integration Complexity**: Applications must manage multiple manager instances

### Neutral Consequences

- **API Compatibility**: Both modular and monolithic APIs are maintained
- **Migration Path**: Existing applications can migrate incrementally

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Monolithic Design

- **Description**: Single large AuthFramework class with all functionality
- **Why Not Chosen**: Tight coupling, difficult testing, large memory footprint
- **Trade-offs**: Simpler integration but less flexibility and scalability

### Alternative 2: Plugin Architecture

- **Description**: Core framework with authentication methods as loadable plugins
- **Why Not Chosen**: Runtime complexity, dynamic loading security concerns
- **Trade-offs**: Maximum flexibility but significant runtime overhead

### Alternative 3: Trait-Based Composition

- **Description**: Define traits for each concern, implement as needed
- **Why Not Chosen**: Lack of concrete implementations, complex for common use cases
- **Trade-offs**: Ultimate flexibility but high implementation burden on users

## Implementation

The modular architecture was implemented through:

1. **Manager Separation**: Created distinct manager structs for each concern
2. **Shared Interfaces**: Common storage and configuration abstractions
3. **Composition Pattern**: ModularAuthFramework composes individual managers
4. **API Compatibility**: Maintained existing AuthFramework API for migration
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive examples for both architectures

Key implementation milestones:

- Individual manager implementations
- Storage abstraction layer
- Configuration sharing system
- Testing framework for isolated components
- Migration documentation and examples
