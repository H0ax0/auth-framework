# ADR-010: Monitoring and Observability Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Authentication systems require comprehensive monitoring and observability for security and operational excellence:

- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time detection of authentication attacks and anomalies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Authentication latency and throughput tracking
- **Operational Visibility**: System health, resource usage, and capacity planning
- **Compliance Requirements**: Audit logs and security event tracking
- **Debugging Support**: Detailed tracing for troubleshooting authentication issues
- **Alerting Requirements**: Proactive notification of security events and system issues
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Consistent monitoring across development, staging, and production

Authentication systems are critical infrastructure requiring comprehensive observability for security, performance, and reliability.

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive observability strategy with security focus:

**Three Pillars of Observability:**

1. **Metrics**: Quantitative performance and security metrics
2. **Logs**: Structured security events and operational logs
3. **Traces**: Distributed tracing for request flow analysis

**Security-Focused Monitoring:**

- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts, failures, rate limiting
- **Security Anomalies**: Unusual patterns, potential attacks, policy violations
- **Compliance Auditing**: Complete audit trail for regulatory requirements
- **Privacy Protection**: Log sanitization and retention policies

**Operational Monitoring:**

- **Performance Metrics**: Latency, throughput, error rates
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, storage, network usage
- **System Health**: Component status, dependency health
- **Capacity Planning**: Usage trends and scaling indicators

**Integration Strategy:**

- **OpenTelemetry**: Standard telemetry collection and export
- **Multiple Backends**: Support for Prometheus, Jaeger, ELK stack
- **Cloud-Native**: Integration with cloud monitoring services
- **On-Premise**: Self-hosted monitoring stack support

## Rationale

Comprehensive observability is essential for authentication system success:

- **Security Excellence**: Real-time threat detection and response capabilities
- **Operational Excellence**: Proactive issue detection and capacity planning
- **Compliance**: Complete audit trail for regulatory and security requirements
- **Developer Experience**: Detailed debugging information and performance insights
- **Business Intelligence**: Usage patterns and system optimization opportunities
- **Incident Response**: Rapid issue identification and resolution

This approach balances security, performance, and operational requirements.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Enhanced Security**: Real-time threat detection and comprehensive audit trails
- **Improved Reliability**: Proactive issue detection and faster incident resolution
- **Performance Optimization**: Detailed performance metrics enable optimization
- **Compliance Support**: Complete audit logs support regulatory requirements
- **Developer Productivity**: Rich debugging information accelerates development
- **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive system visibility and alerting

### Negative Consequences

- **Implementation Complexity**: Comprehensive observability requires significant infrastructure
- **Storage Overhead**: Detailed logging and metrics require substantial storage
- **Performance Impact**: Telemetry collection adds minimal but measurable overhead
- **Privacy Considerations**: Detailed logging requires careful privacy protection

### Neutral Consequences

- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Dedicated monitoring infrastructure requires maintenance
- **Data Retention**: Log and metric retention policies require ongoing management

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Basic Logging Only

- **Description**: Simple file-based logging with minimal metrics
- **Why Not Chosen**: Insufficient for security monitoring and operational visibility
- **Trade-offs**: Simple implementation but poor security and operational insights

### Alternative 2: Cloud Provider Monitoring

- **Description**: Rely exclusively on cloud provider monitoring services
- **Why Not Chosen**: Vendor lock-in and limited customization for authentication-specific metrics
- **Trade-offs**: Easy setup but reduced flexibility and potential vendor dependency

### Alternative 3: Reactive Monitoring

- **Description**: Focus on incident response rather than proactive monitoring
- **Why Not Chosen**: Poor security posture and higher operational costs
- **Trade-offs**: Lower upfront complexity but higher long-term operational risk

## Implementation

The monitoring and observability strategy includes:

1. **Telemetry Collection**: OpenTelemetry-based metrics, logs, and traces
2. **Security Event Monitoring**: Real-time authentication and security event tracking
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Latency, throughput, and error rate tracking
4. **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system and dependency health monitoring
5. **Alerting Framework**: Intelligent alerting with escalation policies
6. **Dashboard Suite**: Operational and security dashboards for visibility

Key implementation features:

```rust
// Metrics collection
use opentelemetry::{metrics::*, KeyValue};

pub struct AuthMetrics {
    auth_attempts: Counter<u64>,
    auth_latency: Histogram<u64>,
    rate_limits_triggered: Counter<u64>,
    active_sessions: UpDownCounter<i64>,
}

impl AuthMetrics {
    pub fn record_auth_attempt(&self, success: bool, method: &str) {
        self.auth_attempts.add(1, &[
            KeyValue::new("success", success),
            KeyValue::new("method", method),
        ]);
    }

    pub fn record_auth_latency(&self, duration: Duration) {
        self.auth_latency.record(
            duration.as_millis() as u64,
            &[KeyValue::new("operation", "authenticate")]
        );
    }
}

// Security event logging
#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]
pub struct SecurityEvent {
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub event_type: SecurityEventType,
    pub user_id: Option<String>,
    pub source_ip: IpAddr,
    pub user_agent: Option<String>,
    pub details: Value,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]
pub enum SecurityEventType {
    LoginAttempt,
    LoginSuccess,
    LoginFailure,
    RateLimitTriggered,
    SuspiciousActivity,
    TokenRevoked,
}

// Distributed tracing
use tracing::{info, warn, error, instrument};

#[instrument(skip(self, credentials))]
pub async fn authenticate_user(
    &self,
    credentials: UserCredentials
) -> Result<AuthResult, AuthError> {
    let start = Instant::now();

    info!("Authentication attempt for user: {}", credentials.username);

    let result = self.verify_credentials(&credentials).await;

    match &result {
        Ok(_) => {
            info!("Authentication successful");
            self.metrics.record_auth_attempt(true, "password");
        },
        Err(e) => {
            warn!("Authentication failed: {}", e);
            self.metrics.record_auth_attempt(false, "password");
        }
    }

    self.metrics.record_auth_latency(start.elapsed());
    result
}
```
