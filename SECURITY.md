# Security Policy

## ðŸš¨ Important Security Notice: RUSTSEC-2023-0071

### Current Vulnerability Status

**RUSTSEC-2023-0071** (Marvin Attack on RSA) affects this framework when using MySQL storage through the SQLx dependency chain. This is a **timing side-channel vulnerability** in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption operations.

**Key Details:**

- **CVE**: CVE-2023-49092
- **Severity**: Medium (CVSS 5.9)
- **Risk Assessment**: **EXTREMELY LOW** in typical production environments
- **Affected Features**: MySQL storage (`mysql-storage` feature)

### Risk Analysis

The vulnerability poses **minimal practical risk** because:

1. **Network Access Required**: Attacker needs ability to trigger RSA operations remotely
2. **Complex Attack**: Requires sophisticated timing analysis over many operations
3. **Limited Exposure**: RSA operations in SQLx are primarily for TLS connection setup
4. **Infrastructure Protection**: Production environments typically have network isolation

### ðŸ”’ **RECOMMENDED SOLUTION**: Use PostgreSQL

**We strongly recommend using PostgreSQL instead of MySQL** to completely eliminate this vulnerability:

```toml
[features]
default = ["postgres-storage"]  # Instead of mysql-storage
```

**Benefits of PostgreSQL Migration:**

- âœ… **Complete RSA elimination** - No RSA dependencies in the chain
- âœ… **Better performance** - Native Rust PostgreSQL drivers
- âœ… **Enhanced features** - Superior JSON support, full-text search
- âœ… **Minimal migration effort** - SQLx provides database-agnostic interface

### Alternative Mitigation Strategies

If PostgreSQL migration is not immediately feasible:

1. **Network Isolation**: Ensure database connections are not exposed to untrusted networks
2. **VPN/Private Networks**: Use secure, isolated network channels for database communication
3. **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling to reduce RSA handshake frequency
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual timing patterns in database operations

### Current Status

- **Production Safe**: Framework is secure for production use with proper network isolation
- **No Immediate Action Required**: Vulnerability is not practically exploitable in typical deployments
- **Long-term Recommendation**: Migrate to PostgreSQL for optimal security posture

## Supported Versions

Currently supported versions of the Auth Framework with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Security Considerations

The Auth Framework is designed with security as a primary concern. However, security is a shared responsibility between the library maintainers and the users implementing it.

### Library Security Features

This library provides:

- **Secure Token Management**: JWT tokens with proper signing and validation
- **Password Hashing**: Argon2 and bcrypt implementations
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with expiration
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Protection against timing attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Audit Logging**: Security event tracking

### User Responsibilities

When using this library, ensure:

- **Secret Management**: Never hardcode secrets in your application
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate signing keys and secrets
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
- **Configuration Review**: Regularly review security configurations
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious authentication patterns

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Library Users

#### Configuration

```rust
// Use strong secrets
let config = AuthConfig::new()
    .security(SecurityConfig::secure()) // Use secure defaults
    .rate_limiting(RateLimitConfig::new(100, Duration::from_secs(60)));
```

#### Secret Management

```rust
// Good: Use environment variables
let secret = std::env::var("JWT_SECRET").expect("JWT_SECRET must be set");

// Bad: Hardcoded secret
let secret = "hardcoded-secret"; // DON'T DO THIS
```

#### Storage

```rust
// Use secure storage in production
let storage = RedisStorage::new("rediss://user:pass@redis.example.com:6380")?;

// Not recommended for production
let storage = MemoryStorage::new(); // Only for development/testing
```

### For Library Contributors

#### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or passwords
- [ ] Proper input validation

#### Security Testing

- [ ] Test with invalid/malformed inputs
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Test token expiration and revocation
- [ ] Test permission boundaries
- [ ] Test against common attack vectors
