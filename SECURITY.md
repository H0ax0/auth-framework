# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently supported versions of the Auth Framework with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Security Considerations

The Auth Framework is designed with security as a primary concern. However, security is a shared responsibility between the library maintainers and the users implementing it.

### Library Security Features

This library provides:

- **Secure Token Management**: JWT tokens with proper signing and validation
- **Password Hashing**: Argon2 and bcrypt implementations
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with expiration
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Protection against timing attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Audit Logging**: Security event tracking

### User Responsibilities

When using this library, ensure:

- **Secret Management**: Never hardcode secrets in your application
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate signing keys and secrets
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
- **Configuration Review**: Regularly review security configurations
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious authentication patterns

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue:

### DO NOT create a public GitHub issue

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. **Encrypt**: Use PGP if possible (key available on request)

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
3. **Fix**: We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
4. **Release**: Security fixes will be released as soon as possible
5. **Credit**: We will credit the reporter unless they prefer to remain anonymous

## Security Best Practices

### For Library Users

#### Configuration

```rust
// Use strong secrets
let config = AuthConfig::new()
    .security(SecurityConfig::secure()) // Use secure defaults
    .rate_limiting(RateLimitConfig::new(100, Duration::from_secs(60)));
```

#### Secret Management

```rust
// Good: Use environment variables
let secret = std::env::var("JWT_SECRET").expect("JWT_SECRET must be set");

// Bad: Hardcoded secret
let secret = "hardcoded-secret"; // DON'T DO THIS
```

#### Storage

```rust
// Use secure storage in production
let storage = RedisStorage::new("rediss://user:pass@redis.example.com:6380")?;

// Not recommended for production
let storage = MemoryStorage::new(); // Only for development/testing
```

### For Library Contributors

#### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or passwords
- [ ] Proper input validation
- [ ] Constant-time operations for sensitive comparisons
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Secure defaults in configurations
- [ ] Updated dependencies

#### Security Testing

- [ ] Test with invalid/malformed inputs
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Test token expiration and revocation
- [ ] Test permission boundaries
- [ ] Test against common attack vectors

## Threat Model

### Assets

- User credentials and authentication data
- Session tokens and API keys
- User personal information
- System configuration and secrets

### Threats

- **Credential Stuffing**: Automated attempts using stolen credentials
- **Brute Force**: Systematic password guessing attempts
- **Session Hijacking**: Stealing or intercepting session tokens
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining unauthorized access levels
- **Timing Attacks**: Exploiting time differences in operations
- **Injection Attacks**: Malicious input exploitation

### Mitigations

- Rate limiting and account lockout
- Strong password requirements
- Secure session management
- Proper authorization checks
- Constant-time operations
- Input validation and sanitization

## Compliance

This library aims to help users meet common security standards:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Address common web application vulnerabilities
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implement security controls
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry security standards
- **GDPR**: Data protection compliance features

## Dependencies

We regularly audit and update dependencies. Security-sensitive dependencies include:

- `ring`: Cryptographic operations
- `jsonwebtoken`: JWT implementation
- `argon2`: Password hashing
- `redis`: Storage backend
- `tokio`: Async runtime

## Changelog

Security-related changes will be clearly marked in the changelog with the `[SECURITY]` tag.
